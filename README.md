# Multi-frame and Multi-Scale Conditional GAN for foreground extraction

Code for multi frame multi scale conditional GAN used in the papers [Multi-frame and Multi-scale Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Efficient Foreground Extraction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-4018-9_20) and [GAN based efficient foreground extraction and HGWOSA based optimization for video synopsis generation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051200421000270) for foreground extraction.

The core requires data in format of [CDNet dataset](http://changedetection.net/).
